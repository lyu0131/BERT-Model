# BERT-Model
A multimodal event detection system.



Faced with an increasing amount of unstructured multimodal data appearing on various social platforms (e.g., Twitter/Instagram), we seek to effectively understand the complex social events portrayed on these platforms. However, conventional information extraction systems cannot understand these data because they cannot handle real-world analysis or require extensive tuning and many manually annotated examples to suc- cessfully comprehend these events. To solve this problem, this paper de- velops a knowledge-oriented artificial intelligence system that can identify and analyze these data and complex events and bring them to the userâ€™s attention. Our research aims to understand complex events described in multimedia inputs by developing a semi-automated system that identifies, links, and temporally sequences their subsidiary elements, the participants involved, as well as the complex event type. This project proposes a sys- tematic analysis of world events, such as the Boston Marathon bombing, Capital Riots, Covid-19, etc. We have successfully evaluated our system on various datasets and have shown significant improvement compared to other previous methods.
